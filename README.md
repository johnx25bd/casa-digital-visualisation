# CASA0003: Digital Visualisation

*group visualisation project, 2019*

## Overview

Exploring the theme of "Invisible Cities", we chose to focus on the people and things the occupy space in our world, and how they got there. Representing the convergence of global supply chains, each product carries an invisible trace through space and time, where each of its constituent parts were sourced, refined, assembled and stored.

We intend to visualize how things move - the transport & logistics network - at the global, national and local scale.

### Global

- Trade flows between countries based on commodity type, etc.
- Ports, with relevant capacities visualized
- Airports
- Key shipping routes or strategic maritime corridors
- Exclusive economic zones
-


### National

- Ports
- Airports
- Roads, by type, perhaps scaled by estimates of freight volumes
- Railroads
- Waterways
- Some estimation of the usage of each
- Historical data of usage, for some time step animation?
- Distribution centers?


### Local

A zoomed in look at one location in the UK critical for transport networks. A port / airport, ideally

**some key layer or thing to visualize?**

- Ships coming in, airplanes coming in?
- How something has changed over time?


- High resolution building, property, road, waterway data
- Raster basemaps, perhaps including navigational charts
